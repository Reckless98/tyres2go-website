    question: 'How do I find the right tyre for my car?',
    answer: 'Choosing the right tyres is vital for your driving experience and road safety. Stick to the tyre sizes recommended for your car, pick the right tread pattern ideal for your driving conditions, and ensure high quality rubber compound for better longevity. Go for a trustworthy brand offering the best warranty. Our expert team can help you choose the perfect tyre for your needs.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'What is the minimum legal tread depth?',
    answer: 'In New Zealand, the minimum legal tread depth is 1.5mm across the full width of the tread. However, we recommend replacing tyres when tread depth reaches 3mm for optimal safety and performance, especially in wet conditions.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'How will I know when to replace my car\'s tyres?',
    answer: 'Replace your tyres when the tread depth is below 3mm, if there are visible cracks or bulges, uneven wear patterns, or if the tyre is more than 6 years old regardless of tread depth. Our technicians can inspect your tyres and provide expert advice.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'Can I check the tread depth of the tyres?',
    answer: 'Yes! Use the 20-cent coin test - insert a 20-cent coin into the tread groove. If you can see the top of the band around the edge of the coin, your tread is too low. You can also visit any of our 6 locations for a free tyre inspection.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'How often should I get a safety check for my vehicle?',
    answer: 'We recommend a comprehensive safety check every 6 months or 10,000km, whichever comes first. For vehicles requiring a WOF, annual inspections are mandatory. Regular checks help identify potential issues before they become serious problems.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'What does a standard vehicle service include?',
    answer: 'Our standard service includes oil and filter change, brake inspection, tyre rotation and pressure check, fluid level checks, battery test, lights and wiper inspection, and a comprehensive safety check. We provide a detailed report of our findings.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'Do you service all types of vehicles?',
    answer: 'Yes! We service all makes and models including passenger cars, 4WDs, SUVs, vans, light trucks, motorhomes, and commercial vehicles. Our experienced technicians are equipped to handle European, Japanese, American, and Korean vehicles.',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: 'What is a Warrant of Fitness (WoF) and why do I need it?',
    answer: 'A WOF is a regular safety check required by law in New Zealand. Vehicles must pass a WOF inspection to ensure they meet minimum safety standards. Most passenger vehicles need a WOF annually, while newer vehicles (first registered after January 2000) need one at 3 years old, then annually.',
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: 'Do you provide mobile tyre services?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our Mobile Tyre Service covers all of Christchurch 7 days a week. We come to your home, office, or anywhere you need us. Our mobile vans are equipped with state-of-the-art fitting and balancing machines. Call 03 341 7675 to book.',
